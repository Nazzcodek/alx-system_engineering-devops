Specifics about this infrastructure:
1. A second server is added for downtime check when maintainace is ongoing
2. A load balancer is added for traffic distribution
3. The load balance uses Weighted Least Connection, Servers are weighted, and requests are directed to the server with the fewest connections.
4. Active-Passive: If the active server fails, the passive server immediately takes over until the active one recovers.

Issues about the Infrastructure:
1. there is measure for SPOF with the addition of server 02
2. No firewall and no secure socket layer certification
3. No monitoring to check for system health status
